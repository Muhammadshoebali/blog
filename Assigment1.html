<p><b>Wipro Limited is an Indian multinational corporation that provides information technology, consulting and business process services. Thierry Delaporte is serving as CEO and managing director of Wipro from July 2020. It is headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.</b></p><b>
The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner, India, by Mohamed Premji as Western India Vegetable Products Limited, later abbreviated to Wipro. It was initially set up as a manufacturer of vegetable and refined oils under the trade names of Kisan, Sunflower, and Camel.[6][7][8]
In 1966, after Mohamed Premji's death, his son Azim Premji took over Wipro as its chairman at the age of 21</b>
<i>During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry, which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited.[7] In 1982, the name was changed again, from Wipro Products Limited to Wipro Limited.[11] In 1999, Wipro was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[12] In 2004, Wipro became the second Indian IT company to earn $1 billion in annual revenue
In 2012, Wipro demerged its non-IT businesses into a separate company called Wipro Enterprises.[14][15][16] Prior to this demerger, these businesses, mainly in the consumer care, lighting, furniture, hydraulics, water treatment, and medical diagnostics, contributed about 10% of Wipro's total revenues.[17][18]
In August 2018, Wipro paid US$75m to National Grid US as a settlement for a botched SAP implementation that an 2014 audit estimated could cost the company US$1 billion. Wipro had been hired as systems integrator in 2010, but errors in the rollout, intended to replace an Oracle system, caused serious losses and reputational damage.[19]In March 2020, Hedera announced that Wipro would be joining their Governing Council, providing decentralized governance to its hashgraph distributed ledger technology.</i>
